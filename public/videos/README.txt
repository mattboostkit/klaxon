# Video Placeholder Instructions

To make the hero video work properly on the website, please add an MP4 video file named `klaxon_showreel.mp4` in this directory.

This file is required for the homepage hero section and the "Play Showreel" functionality to work correctly when Sanity CMS is unavailable or experiencing CORS issues.

## Requirements:
- File name must be: klaxon_showreel.mp4
- Format: MP4
- Recommended resolution: 1920x1080
- Recommended duration: 30-60 seconds
- Recommended size: Under 10MB for faster loading

If you don't have a specific showreel video, you can use any video that represents your brand or a generic placeholder video.
